# Promise.

I don’t break promises.

Sure, I may have to cancel appointments from time to time, or postpone some commitments, but when I say **“I promise,”** I mean it.

On the 18th of March, 2008, [I made a promise that if Barack Obama won the presidency, I would move to the United States of America.](../obama-and-history) At that point, Obama was still an underdog in the Democratic primary race and the presidency seemed a long way away.

Yesterday, Barack Obama took his place in the White House as the 44th President of the United States of America.

This week, _I keep my promise_ and move into a new apartment in Washington DC.

I’m starting a new contract with the World Bank here this week, and will be in the District for at least the next few months. If you’re ever in the area, be sure to drop me a line and say hullo over coffee.
