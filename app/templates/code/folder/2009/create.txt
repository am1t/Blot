# Create.

Today is the first day of 2009, which reminds me of a beautiful and inspiring quotation by my favorite poet, [T.S. Eliot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot):

> For last year’s words belong to last year’s language  
> And next year’s words await another voice.  
> And to make an end is to make a beginning.

I’m not ready to make New Year’s resolutions; I am ready to make New Year’s commitments.

- I commit to continue to strive to make at least one person smile every day.
- I commit to embrace change and learn from new experiences and encounters.
- I commit to approach any opportunity with positivity, courage, and resolve.
- I commit to push myself to create things that provide value to the world around me.

Every year, I pick one word to guide my actions and decisions throughout the next twelve months. This year, that word is **create**. Hopefully my commitment to creation will be reflected in things I do and say this year. Let me know if you think I’m slipping. Everyone needs a nudge back on track from time to time.

What are your commitments to yourself this year? Do you have a word that will guide you through 2009?
