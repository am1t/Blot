# Teacher.

I’ve been thinking a lot about teachers, recently. Perhaps it is because I’ve started teaching a post-secondary class, or perhaps it is because I am wondering when and if I should start thinking about going back to school. Perhaps it is because I read [The Last English Teacher](http://www.themillions.com/2015/01/the-last-english-teacher.html) by Nick Ripatrazone and it reminded me of so many of the great teachers I have had throughout my life. Here’s [a snippet from Nick’s piece](http://www.themillions.com/2015/01/the-last-english-teacher.html):

> “I teach every class like it is my last. It could be. When I started teaching, I thought my purpose was to create a legion of English majors. I have learned that my purpose is to pause the lives of my students for long enough that a line of poetry is the loudest sound they encounter during the day.”

I think, perhaps, I shall write more about teachers and teaching, sometime soon. For now, here is a list of a few teachers, off the top of my head, that have made considerable impact on me and have been a large part of making me who I am:

*   Mme. Boughton
*   Mme. Sherman
*   Mrs. Sitarek
*   Mr. Niedre
*   Mrs. Hollinger
*   Mrs. Padmore
*   Mr. Novak
*   Mrs. Robbins
*   Mr. Robertson
*   Mr. Legault
*   Mme. Jean-Baptiste
*   Nico Bethel
*   Eileen Dombrowski
*   Reverend Alvaro Ribeiro
*   Dr. Joshua Barker
*   Dr. Sarah Salih

There are many, many more not listed here. I am eternally thankful to every single one of them.
