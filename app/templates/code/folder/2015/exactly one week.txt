# Exactly one week.

There is a palpable glow on my face right now. I know this because people tell me this regularly, from friends to colleagues to strangers. I know this because the first thing I do every morning when I wake up is smile.

I’m [getting married](../she-said-yes) in exactly one week.

I’m [getting married](../she-said-yes) to a woman who loves me, supports me, invigorates me, and inspires me. I’m [getting married](../she-said-yes) to a woman who makes me giddy with delight every time I see her, who motivates me to be a better man, every day. I’m [getting married](../she-said-yes) to someone I love more than I ever thought I could ever love.

The palpable glow on my face is understandable: I love, and am loved, and we are celebrating our love with our family and friends in exactly one week.

I’m so excited for our celebration next week, but I’m even more excited about the life we’re building together now, and the one we’ll continue to build after our special day.

This glow isn’t going anywhere, and I couldn’t be happier for it to stay.
