# This is good.

**The Weather**<br />

_From: Apology for Absence: Selected Poems 1962-1992_

> I'd like to live a slower life.  
> The weather gets in my words  
> and I want them dry. Line after line  
> writes itself on my face, not a grace  
> of age but wrinkled humour. I laugh  
> more than I should or more  
> than anyone should. This is good.

> But guess again. Everyone leans, each  
> on each other. This is a life  
> without an image. But only  
> because nothing does much more  
> than just resemble. Do the shamans  
> do what they say they do, dancing?  
> This is epistemology.

> This is guesswork, this is love,  
> this is giving up gorgeousness to please you,  
> you beautiful dead to be. God bless  
> the weather and the words. Any words. Any weather.  
> And where or whom. I'd never taken count before.  
> I wish I had. And then  
> I did. And here  
> the weather wrote again.
