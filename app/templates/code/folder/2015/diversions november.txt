# Diversions: November

### A selection of essays, articles, and blog posts that inspired me this month.

**[Frightened, Ignorant and Cowardly is No Way to Go Through Life, Son](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/11/20/frightened-ignorant-and-cowardly-is-no-way-to-go-through-life-son/)**  
John Scalzi makes a coherent argument about how the increased islamophobia in the United States these past few weeks (years?) is shortsighted, and the result of pure bigotry.

**[The Mother of All Questions](http://harpers.org/archive/2015/10/the-mother-of-all-questions/)**  
What is happiness, and why is our contemporary writing on happiness so focused on striving towards it, instead of finding it wherever we are?

**[On the Existential Beauty of Peanuts](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/11/the-existential-beauty-of-peanuts)**  
One of the things I’ve always loved about _Peanuts_ was its willingness to explore pathos, melancholy, and futility—all wrapped up in a comic strip about children.

**[The True Costs of Driving](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/driving-true-costs/412237/)**  
Confirmation of something we all knew: driving is a heavily-subsidized form of transportation. I wonder how many people would choose alternate forms of transportation if they actually had to pay the real cost of driving.

**[How our housing choices make adult friendships more difficult](http://www.vox.com/2015/10/28/9622920/housing-adult-friendship)**  
One of the best parts of living in our current neighborhood is that we are forced to interact with people in the neighborhood, in a spontaneous, random way, just by its design. The contemporary suburb is removing that serendipity.

**[How To Make New Friends As An Adult, And Why](http://adequateman.deadspin.com/how-to-make-new-friends-as-an-adult-and-why-1739018093)**  
I’ve had no issues with making friends in adulthood, but quite a few people have told me that they find it tricky. This is a pretty good article that breaks down some ways to make new friends as you get older.

**[The Science Hidden In Your Town Name](http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/the-science-hidden-in-your-town-name)**  
The names of our cities say a lot about their nature—if only we could remember what they all mean. I like that Toronto means “where there are trees in water.”

**[Confessions of a Paywall Journalist](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novemberdecember_2015/features/confessions_of_a_paywall_journ058444.php)**  
Many of my colleagues ask me how I’m so quickly in the loop about all the policies and discussions happening at a political level in my line of work. The not-so-secret answer is that I read a lot of trade policy publications, so this was a fascinating read about how they operate.

**[As Books Disappear, Libraries Are Still Transforming the World](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/11/libraries_are_changing_international_development.html)**  
I’ve been having a lot of conversations about libraries and their role in civic discourse, but had completely ignored their role in international development.

**[Here’s What Happens When You Put More Women in Government](http://time.com/4101749/justin-trudeau-women-cabinet-parliament-government/)**  
Very proud of our new government being interested in a diversity of representation in Cabinet; now, the rest of the country needs to catch up.

**[Chicken Nugget Smackdown](http://adequateman.deadspin.com/chicken-nugget-smackdown-wendys-vs-burger-king-vs-mc-1740798438)**  
As an avid fan of the fast-food chicken nugget (I know, I know), I could have told you that Wendy’s was the clear winner before reading this analysis.

**[The Most Common Job In Each State 1978-2014](http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/hist-job-map-90/child.html?initialWidth=800)**  
Incredible how, over the years, certain jobs (secretary, truck driver) have dominated the entire country’s employment landscape.

**[Every Episode of Saved By The Bell, Ranked](http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/every-episode-of-saved-by-the-bell-ranked.html)**  
Almost impossible to argue with this list. Was nice to revisit all those episodes again, years later.

**[Griever](http://hazlitt.net/longreads/griever)**  
There are certain pieces of fiction that are so haunting that they stay with you for a long time. This is one of those pieces.

**[How To Argue Without Ruining Your Relationship](http://adequateman.deadspin.com/how-to-argue-without-ruining-your-relationship-1737367081)**  
One of the hallmarks of an excellent relationship, I’ve heard over and over again, is the ability to argue in a productive, loving way. I’m so glad that I’m in one of those wonderful relationships.

**[Gasp! A Breathing Puzzle](http://noticing.co/how-insects-breathe/)**  
I never thought that a dissertation on the science of insect breathing could be this fascinating.

**[On Master of None, the Kids Are All Right, But the Parents Are Better](http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/master-of-none-recap-season-1-episode-2.html)**  
We’ve only watched a few episodes of Aziz Ansari’s show so far, but the second episode, about immigrant parents, continues to resonate.

**[Unfollow: Conversion via Twitter](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/conversion-via-twitter-westboro-baptist-church-megan-phelps-roper)**  
A fascinating look at the former voice of the Westboro Baptist Church, and how and why she left.

**[On What People Think](http://danishapiro.wpengine.com/on-what-people-think-2/)**  
Life mantra: “Be generous… it’s so much easier to be a critic than to be a celebrator. To understand and to be understood, these are among life’s greatest gifts, and every interaction is an opportunity to exchange them.”
