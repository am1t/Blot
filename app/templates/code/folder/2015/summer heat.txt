# Summer heat.

Yesterday, over my lunch break, I decided to take a walk to the park and sit outside and do some reading. My stack of library books is ever-growing, and there are only so many times you can renew a book before the system starts getting angry at you.

I returned indoors after less than ten minutes.

The heat yesterday was unbearable. With the humidex, we easily broke 100 degrees (closer to 110, actually), and the air was still and stifling. This entire week has been filled with hot, sticky days where you don’t feel like doing anything but sitting in your underwear in your air-conditioned home and eat ice cream.

It is a heat that encourages stasis, not progress.

July has felt like a month of stasis among change. I started a new job (more on that later) but still feel like I haven’t gone anywhere. Wedding planning continues apace, but instead of crossing things off a list, I feel as though I have been adding more to the list instead. The weeks of summer fly by, and yet it feel as though all I have done is sit around, embrace the air conditioning, and eat ice cream.

Perhaps this is good for me. Perhaps it is a (much-warranted) reminder that sometimes it’s okay to run in place. Perhaps August will fly by, and I will miss the decadence of July’s heat, knowing that no matter how much I did, how much activity occupied my days, I did not need to try to run too far through the sticky air, and for that, I should be thankful.
