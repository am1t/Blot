I need to find a Chrome extension which overlays a grid on the page. Also a way to blur the page too!

I like very much about this, the footnotes location! The figcaption style, the title proportions: https://forgotten-shapes.com/gerstner-programm/gerstnerprogramm-regular/typetester?article=gerstner-programm 
I very much like the typography (Plex Serif!) of the IA blog: https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period

Use modularscale.com to compute a typographic scale: https://www.modularscale.com

Nice full-bleed images: https://ohnotype.co/blog/the-process-of-vulf-mono

Nice header, footer: https://frerejones.com/blog/archeology-and-invention-designing-empirica

Nice search: https://frerejones.com/families/empirica

I like the scale and code snippets further down this page: https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography

I like the code highlighting used on this blog: https://fvsch.com/css-locks/

I like the search input from this page: https://www.futurefonts.xyz/browse

As an aside, this site has some cool typographic critiques: http://typesites.com/the-globe-and-mail/

I like the layout of the footer, and the list of articles above. Good for index page? https://typographica.org/

I like the icons: https://www.typotheque.com/blog/wind_a_layered_typeface_for_optical_illusions
