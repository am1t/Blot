<p2>↑ This is me right now.</p2>

&nbsp;

<h2>I am always focused on solving current problems and creating systems that prevent future ones.</h2>

<h2>Where I work, we keep a very steady pulse. In [*Traction*](http://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business-ebook/dp/B007QWLLV2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453686507&sr=1-1&keywords=traction) lingo, we're a 90-day company. That means we set detailed, quarterly goals and monitor them in weekly departmental meetings that *everyone* attends. Each person on team, including me, is responsible for these goals; they're documented and understood by all.</h2>

As usual, the last two quarters were very busy. I got the following things done:

- Redesigned my agency marketing website design audit system and presentation. Should be able to show that sometime soon.
- Released some new content features to the <A href="http://www.newfangled.com" target="_blank">Newfangled</a> website. Check out the "we've thought a lot about" content theme slider toward the bottom of the home page. 
- co-wrote a couple of white papers, one on <a href="https://www.newfangled.com/whitepapers/predictable-struggle-avoiding-common-pitfalls-digital-marketing/" target="_blank">the common pitfalls of digital marketing</a>, and the other on <a href="https://www.newfangled.com/whitepapers/the-sales-and-marketing-relationship/" target="_blank">the relationship between sales and marketing</a>.
- welcomed my daughter into the world on February 6th and took off some serious time to be with her and her mom
- did Whole30 and (somewhat unintentionally) lost 15 pounds

<p style="text-align: center;">✳</p>

I've got a few specific professional goals this quarter. They include:

- Finishing the design of Newfangled's "Insight Engine" — a data synthesize and analytics system that began as an idea I had in October, 2015, when I went on sabbatical. More to come on that soon…
- Updating the design of as many of Newfangled's internal documents and sales materials as possible.
- I've started 9 new design consulting engagements so far this year, and should be on-boarding 4 more before the end of this quarter… so, finishing those well.

I also have a few personal goals that I'm working on, some of which I'm carrying over from last quarter:

- rebooting (yet again) my [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/chrbutler)
- starting a new podcast! It's called <i>The Liminal</i>, and it's coming soon.
- making as much time for my wife and daughter as possible
