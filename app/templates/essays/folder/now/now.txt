<h2>I amâ€¦</h2>

- doing <i>less</i>. Last year a book that had a tremendous impact on how I work (and specifically, how I spend my time working) was <i><A href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516306442&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+work" target="_blank">Deep Work</a></i>, by Cal Newport. This year, I suspect that two books will provoke a similarly big shift in how I do and think about things. First, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rest-More-Done-When-Work-ebook/dp/B01IMZ5DR4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1516306517&sr=1-1&keywords=rest" target="_blank">Rest</a></i>, by Alex Pang, and <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gnomon-novel-Nick-Harkaway-ebook/dp/B071R1GVX2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1516306561&sr=1-1&keywords=gnomon" target="_blank">Gnomon</a></i>, by Nick Harkaway. <i>Rest</i> is a great companion to <i>Deep Work</i>, in that it addresses how to think and use the time you get back when you work more efficiently. And though <i>Gnomon</i> is a novel, it is constantly bringing ideas to mind and provoking thought about how I engage with technology and others.
