Thirty-Four (a lifetime mix)
====================
<p2>It's the end of the year; why not another list? This one is a bit different, though. A friend shared with me the idea of making a mix of songs from each year of your life. I loved the idea, so I've made my own. It was a challenging task! I tried my best to stick to one song per year, with a few exceptions for years when choosing only one was just too difficult. There were also some years in which good choices were relatively few. Below, I've included my final list and a link to the spreadsheet I created to work through my choices, which includes all the runners-up from 1980 through 2014.</p2>

<p2>If this inspires you to create a lifetime mix of your own, I'd love to hear it!</p2>
