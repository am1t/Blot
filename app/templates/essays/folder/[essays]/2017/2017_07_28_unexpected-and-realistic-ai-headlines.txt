Unexpected and Realistic AI Headlines, Among Other Things
====================

<p>Hello, friends, and welcome new ones!</p>

<p>Picture me staring at eight different TextEdit windows, each full of notes of things I've been thinking about lately and had saved there with the thought that perhaps they'd turn into posts. You know, on their own — magically. Alas, that is not to be, and seeing as I need a gentle way of getting back into this blogging business, I have mashed them all up together in another mixpost (for those new to not-thinking-about-the-future, past mixposts have included <A href="/a-200-word-mixpost" target="_blank">this one</a>,  <A href="/etc-etc-etc" target="_blank">this one</a>, <A href="/randoposto" target="_blank">this one</a>, <A href="/the-gift-in-our-work" target="_blank">this one</a>, and <A href="/step-aside-keep-quiet-and-listen" target="_blank">this one</a>).</p>

<p>Track (1) <b>The Nexus of Impact, Pleasure, and Profit</b></p>

<p>A bit later in this mix, I'm going to be recommending a book about expertise by an expert in expertise. I know that sounds terrible, but it's really not. The author cares deeply about helping organizations figure out what they are best at and redesign their businesses to pursue only that kind of work. Trust me, it's easier said than done. Much easier.</p>

<p>But I think a lot about that idea — what companies are best at — and you really can't sort that out without using that inquiry as a probe that goes deeper and deeper into an organization. You cannot know what a company is best at without also knowing what its divisions — its teams — are best at, and you cannot know what a company's teams are best at without also knowing what the people who comprise those teams are best at. And the best way of thinking about this whole "best at" idea is to think about it in terms of unique ability. This is something I mentioned a long while back while I was <A href="/sabbaticalifragilisticexpialidocious" target="_blank">on sabbatical</a>. Back then, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>"…unique ability is a more subtle concept, one that each of us is responsible for discerning so that our work will be of maximum value to ourselves and to each other. When too many of us are doing too many things, we’re working hard but we’re not working as intelligently as we could be. Discerning our unique ability helps us to focus in on the ways in which it brings value to the firm, and let go of those things we have been doing that are probably more profitably done by someone else…"</blockquote>

<p>A simple way to look at unique ability is to think about it in terms of what you are best at that you and others get the most value from. This means there are three qualifiers of unique ability: (1) what you do better than others, (2) that you enjoy doing most, (3) that benefits others most. This rubric works for companies, and it works for teams, and it works for individuals.</p>

<p>At the company level, I advise a very simple method for figuring this out that I call the "ideal client inquiry." It goes like this:</p>

<p>Looking at your catalog of work and experience, where does each past and current engagement sit relative to a nexus of impact, profit, and pleasure? Imagine a simple venn diagram: three circles, in clockwise order, labeled "impact," "pleasure," and "profit." Those that engagements that sit at the center of this diagram are your ideal ones — work for clients who should serve as the model for the future clients you pursue. Without excellence, you won't have had impact, so that covers what you are "best" at. Pleasure is self-explanatory. And profit, well, for companies, that can be measured in dollars. For an individual, though, that might be interpreted in different ways.  For instance, it might be the revenue or profit they're directly responsible for, or their own income, or some other qualitative scale they use to measure such a thing. In any case, the closer a <i>future</i> opportunity can be to the center — and of course, for a future opportunity, your assessment would be an informed projection — the more a company is able to operate within its unique ability. Now like I said, you can swap out "company" for "team" or "person" pretty easily.</p>

<p>The reason this is a useful exercise is that it can be difficult to assess unique ability in the abstract — though not impossible, depending upon your own self insight — but it's a whole lot easier when you use an inductive survey (of sorts) to reflect these qualifications of unique ability back at you.</p>

<p>Try it out for yourself and see what your own history tells you about your unique ability.</p>

<p>Track (4) <b>Another Podcast Update</b></p>

<p>As I shared with you last time, I started a podcast. It's called <a href="http://www.theliminal.co/" target="_Blank"><i>The Liminal</i></a>, and it's basically about seeing reality in new ways. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/introduction-to-the-liminal/id1260370041?i=1000389947345&mt=2" target="_blank">Episode 1</a> is a brief story about Charles Fort and his <i>Book of the Damned</i> — a catalog of strange phenomena that he felt had been "damned" to obscurity by scientific thinking that refused to acknowledge it. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/what-is-a-dream/id1260370041?i=1000390024069&mt=2" target="_blank">Episode 2</a> is about dreams and goes from think about what dreams are all the way to using dream states to expand perception beyond the limits of time and space. Episode 3 is coming soon — next week! — and will be about sound. But not just any sound, of course. I'll give you a hint. It's called <i>The Sound of Cosmic Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>It's been a blast making this podcast, and I've been blown away/encouraged/intimidated/overjoyed by its reception so far. If you've enjoyed it, you can help me in two ways: (1) Leave a review at iTunes. Reviews make or break a podcast, especially in its early days. (2) Spread the word the old fashioned way and just tell a friend about it. One friend. That'd be a huge help/gift to me.</p>

<p>You can subscribe to <i>The Liminal</i> on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-liminal/id1260370041?mt=2" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Idmdiq363cqhy3xadvlvily76rq?t=The_Liminal" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://pca.st/TmWu" target="_blank">PocketCasts</a>, or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-898599245" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, and you can follow the show on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theliminal/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/liminalco" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I probably won't mention the podcast here that often, so if you're interested in regular updates about it, you can <a href="http://tinyletter.com/theliminal" target="_blank">subscribe to dispatches from <i>The Liminal</i></a> here.</p>
