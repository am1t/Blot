<p>Hi from a quiet house that smells of roasting beets.</p>

<p>I've decided that writing a semi-public journal might be an interesting experience. Public in that it's here; Google can crawl it; you can find it. Semi in that I'm not telling anyone about it. I wonder sometimes whether anything is quietly discoverable anymore.</p>

<p>The most important thing that differentiates a blog from every other form of published writing is freedom. Total freedom. I can write anything I want. After almost a couple of decades with this form, it's too easy to take this for granted. But we shouldn't. A blog is special. Perhaps even more so now that we have the tweet, the wall post, the instagram, the snap. And I would further differentiate the blog from the self-published personal essay, where there is an impulse &mdash; a need &mdash; to edit one's self &mdash; to impose a rigor &mdash; to earn the reader's attention. A blog need do no such thing. I can write anything I want.</p>
