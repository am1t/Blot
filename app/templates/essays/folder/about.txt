<h1>Hello.</h1>

<h2>I'm Chris. I'm a designer and a writer. I currently serve as Chief Design Officer at [Newfangled](http://www.newfangled.com).</h2>

I was born in Winchester, Massachusetts in 1980. I've called many places home since then, including Brookline, MA; Wilmington, DE; Detroit, MI; Providence, RI; Penang, Malaysia; and, since 2006, North Carolina. I live with my wife, daughter, dog, cat, and six chickens in Durham, NC.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/chrbutler), <a href="http://www.instagram.com/chrbutler">Instagram</a>, and good old-fashioned email (chrbutler {at} gmail dot com).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Podcasting</h3>

I'm the creator of [Design Tomorrow](http://www.designtomorrow.co), a podcast about design, technology, and being human. It was born out of my newsletter, <i>Don't Think About the Future</i>.

I'm also the creator of [The Liminal](http://www.theliminal.co), a podcast (on hiatus right now) about conscious metaphysical speculation and the future of minds â€” or, in other words, the strange, fuzzy lines between the greater reality and the little bits of it we happen to know about.

I'm also a co-host of Newfangled's [Expert Marketing Matters](https://www.newfangled.com/digital-marketing-advice-for-agencies/?category=podcasts) podcast, a bi-weekly show about what's current in digital marketing. We cover design, content strategy, CRM, marketing automation, and just about everything in between.

<h3>Writing</h3>

I've written many articles covering a wide range of design-related topics, but I think my most unique contributions tend to be when I write about my passion for design <i>leadership</i> (defined above) and the way culture evolves through the creation and integration of new technologies.

I've also written a book on how web designers can strategically enrich their practice, called *<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Web-Designer-Confidently-Navigate/dp/1440315027/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1453683670&sr=8-1&keywords=the+strategic+web+designer" target="_blank">The Strategic Web Designer</a>* (HOW Books, 2012). 

You can find my articles here in the <a href="/archives">archive</a>, as well as at <a href="http://www.newfangled.com/digital-marketing-advice-for-independent-agencies/?author=chris-butler-blog" target="_blank">Newfangled</a>, <a href="http://www.printmag.com/author/christopher-butler/" target="_blank">PRINT</a>, <a href="http://www.howdesign.com/author/christopher-butler/" target="_blank">HOW</a>, and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/christopher-butler/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>.

I also write a regular newsletter called [Don't Think About The Future](http://www.tinyletter.com/chrbutler). If you're interested in long emails containing strong opinions about design, technology, and being human, sign up anytime.

<h3>Speaking and Events</h3>

I've spoken on interactive design and digital marketing topics at a wide variety of events and organizations, including HOW Design Live, the HOW Interactive Design Conference &mdash; for which I served on the advisory board for five years and was the Program Director for two &mdash; the AIGA, the American Marketing Association, the UCDA Design Summit, ConvergeSE, RISD's Entrepreneur Mindshare, the Hopscotch Design Festival, High Five Conference, and many others. Some of my favorite talks are:

- [The Permanent Transition](https://www.newfangled.com/permanent-transition/)
- [Finding Design in the Process](https://www.newfangled.com/finding-design-in-the-process-at-how-design-live/)
- [Responsive Design at 10,000 Feet](https://www.newfangled.com/responsive-design-at-10000-feet/)
- [You, the *Other* Kind of Business Leader](https://www.newfangled.com/you-the-other-kind-of-business-leader/)
- [Human Progress Landscape](https://www.newfangled.com/human-progress-landscape/)
- [After Content Marketing](https://www.newfangled.com/the-future-of-content-marketing/)

If reading heavily-illustrated transcripts of hour-long talks isn't your thing and you just must see and hear what I'm *actually* like on stage, then I suppose [this video of my talk on "The Permanent Transition"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPu-A2FUfRk) from the 2014 HOW Interactive Design Conference will do.
